# Weather-Search

## Description
Weather Search was designed to find cities of your choice and display the current state of the weather along with a 5-Day Forecast. I designed this project to improve my knowledge using Bootstrap, CSS, JS, JQuery, and linking to an external API, Openweather.org, to capture the weather forecast. Throughout the project I learned how to nest fetch call together and instance variables, displaying Icons, and local storage with understanding how JSON.parse and JSON.stringify work.
